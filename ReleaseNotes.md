## Alias V4

> By downloading and using this software, you agree that 1/6 of the staking
> rewards are contributed to a development fund. The development fund aims
> to support the long term development and value of Alias. The fund is managed
> by the Alias core team.

This is a major release and a **MANDATORY** update to the Alias software!
This update involves consensus changes (_details below_) and **you MUST
update** your wallet software before:

2019-09-27 (_27th September 2019_) @ 2000 hours (GMT)

If you do not update your wallet software you will no longer be able to connect
to the Alias network and you will no longer be able to conduct transactions on
the network and you will no longer be able to deposit or withdraw your funds
(public a/o private ALIAS) from the exchanges.

### Development Contribution Blocks (DCB)
After 21/08/2018 @ 2200 hours (GMT) one in six (1 in 6) block rewards will be
a designated DCB and will be sent to the Alias team development fund wallet.
This fund will ensure a future for Alias and will enable us to pay for certain
services, to hire contractors and to pay Alias core team members in ALIAS
to enable them to work full time on the project. The further development
depend on a source of steady funding. We believe this will give us the opportunity
to produce better software and will create value for investors. We currently
have some very skilled developers working for us and we want to keep it that way.

### Replay Protection
We have implemented a check for DCBs and we have implemented a replay protection
mechanism. This means that after 17/05/2019 @ 2000 hours (GMT) any wallets not
updated will not be able to create transactions on the Alias V3 network.
